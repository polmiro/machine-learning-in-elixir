# Machine Learning In Elixir

Purchased Sean Moriarty's book Machine Learning in Elixir with the intent to learn some basics in machine learning while solidfying and having some fun with Elixir. The examples will run locally on my machine on Ubuntu using the docker version of Livebook.

## Installation

The Nvidia drivers and Nvidia container toolkit can be installed in Ubuntu roughly following the steps in this [Elixir forum thread](https://elixirforum.com/t/is-there-a-way-to-setup-livebook-with-cuda-in-a-docker-image/56560/4). I verified that CUDA was working by running Stable Diffusion locally on [this notebook](00_installation/setting_up_cuda.livemd).
